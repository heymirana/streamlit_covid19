Thanks to data linked to covid19 from Senegal , here a prototype about what is possible by using streamlit


Use the app folder provided, fill-in the `app.py` file with the code from your notebook (make necessary changes if needed). 

Then, view your streamlit app by running ```streamlit run app.py``` from the app's home directory.

Streamlit is using port 8501 by default.
